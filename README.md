# GroupBuilder

### What Does GroupBuilder Do?
- When activated, GroupBuilder auto invites players that "whisper" your character when specific requirements are met.
  - Gearscore is above the minimum gearscore.
  - Spec/role specification required. (Generally, specifying a spec is sufficient; for example, 'Disc' will be assumed as healer. However, certain specs like Frost DK are ambiguous and require clarification since they can be either a tank or a DPS.)
  - Most of the time Class is inferred from the spec/role. (For instance, Frost DK and Frost Mage; we can't infer the class from just "Frost".)
  - Messages players back asking for the missing pieces of information that we need. (A maximum of 1 whisper to any player.)
      - Remembers the pieces of information that we need from previous messages.
- Available Options
  - Maximum/Minimum of a certain class.
  - Maximum of a certain class/role combo. (healer shaman, ranged dps shaman, etc.)
